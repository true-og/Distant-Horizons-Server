# Distant Horizons Server Plugin

DH Support is a Bukkit/Spigot/Paper/Folia server plugin that transmits Level Of Detail (LOD) data to players with Distant Horizons installed. Distant Horizons _will_ work fine without this plugin, but then each client will have to be within normal view distance of chunks to load them, and they will not receive updates for distant chunks when they change. 

## Installing and configuring

Please see [our wiki](https://gitlab.com/distant-horizons-team/distant-horizons-server-plugin/-/wikis/home) for details.

## Building

This project uses Gradle.

`gradlew clean build`
